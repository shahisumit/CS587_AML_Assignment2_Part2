Part 2 of Assignment 2 for CS 587 - Adversarial Machine Learning course, taught by Alexandar Vakanski in Spring 2024 at the University of Idaho - Department of Computer Science.

The objective of this assignment is to create a substitute model for celebrity recognition, and transfer adversarial samples to a corresponding model hosted by Clarifai. This is a black-box attack, because we donâ€™t have access to the model hosted by Clarifai.
